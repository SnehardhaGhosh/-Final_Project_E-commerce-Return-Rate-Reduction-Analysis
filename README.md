E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis
📌 Project Overview

Product returns are one of the biggest challenges in e-commerce, affecting profitability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. This project focuses on analyzing order and return data to identify patterns, calculate return probabilities, and provide actionable insights to reduce return rates.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical orders and returns data.

Calculate return percentages across categories, suppliers, and regions.

Identify key factors contributing to high return rates.

Provide visual insights using dashboards (Power BI).

Suggest strategies to minimize return rates.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) → Data cleaning, feature engineering, return probability model.

SQL (DuckDB/MySQL) → Data queries, joins, aggregations.

Power BI → Interactive dashboard visualization.

Excel/CSV → Data preprocessing and integration.

📊 Key Analysis

Return rate calculation at order, category, and supplier level.

Identified categories with 100% return rate.

Created return probability column using logistic regression.

Built dashboards showing:

Regional return percentages

Supplier performance

High-risk categories

Return probability distribution

🔑 Insights

Some categories consistently show high return percentages, indicating issues with product quality or mismatch in expectations.

Specific suppliers have significantly higher return rates, requiring stricter quality checks.

Regional variations in returns suggest logistics and delivery issues.

🚀 Recommendations

Strengthen supplier quality control for high-return categories.

Provide detailed product descriptions and accurate sizing guides.

Introduce AI-driven recommendation systems to reduce mismatched purchases.

Use predictive modeling to flag high-risk orders before fulfillment.
